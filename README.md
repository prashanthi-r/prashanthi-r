### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Prashanthi, a recent graduate from Brown University in Computer Science. Here, you will find my projects:

- [InterTwine](https://github.com/prashanthi-r/interTwineApp): An end-to-end real-time collaborative story-telling tool based on [Twine](https://twinery.org) (a browser cache-based app) with Auth0 authentication for user accounts and real-time document sharing/editing
- [Spot The Door](https://github.com/Open-Door-Spot): A Flask server to enable seamless interaction between VR and Boston Dynamics Spot, achieving low-latency (160 ms) communication
- [TrainDy](https://github.com/prashanthi-r/traindy): A recommendation engine for H&M consumers using k-means clustering and a combination of ML algorithms
- [Super Resolution GAN](https://github.com/prashanthi-r/viVID): A complete implementation of [SRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802), a GAN-based model for image super-resolution, producing images with 4x improved perceptual quality
  - [Demo](https://youtu.be/qPOHbwBIFx0)
  - [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/vividgan)
- [HyperFunds](https://github.com/prashanthi-r/hyperfunds): A full-stack application on Hyperledger Fabric to ensure that faculty at a university spend their fixed reserve of funds reliably with approval from the right parties
